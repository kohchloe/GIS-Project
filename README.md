## Project Overview
Singapore has been facing a serious issue of low birth rates and changing demographics in our housing estates in recent years. As a result, the government has decided to merge pairs of schools so as to ensure that all schools still have an adequate number of students and a vibrant learning experience with a good range of educational programmes and co-curricular activities.

Through this project, we aim to **find out how these mergers have affected the accessibility of schools in Singapore for students**. We hope to be able to provide meaningful insights on the effects of these mergers so as to provide actionable suggestions for future planning of land use.

### Research Questions
- Are there enough schools in the area to meet demands in different regions of Singapore?
- Which areas have less schools and hence are less accessible which may potentially affect the choices of housing?
- How has the merging and closure of schools affected accessibility of schools to people?
