## Project Motivation

Singapore has been facing a serious issue of low birth rates and changing demographics in our housing estates in recent years. As a result, the government has decided to merge pairs of schools so as to ensure that all schools still have an adequate number of students and a vibrant learning experience with a good range of educational programmes and co-curricular activities.

Hence, in this project, we want to find out how these mergers have affected the accessibility of schools in Singapore for students. We studied the data collected and prepared a report to present our findings and results.

## Project Objectives

Our objective is to prepare a report of survey covering these aspects of our study area to answer these important questions:\

-   How has the merging and closure of schools affected accessibility of schools to people? 

-   Are there enough schools in the area to meet demands in different regions of Singapore? 

-   Which areas have less schools and hence are less accessible which may potentially affect the choices of housing?

-   Analyse how all these factors have affected the equity of access to schools in Singapore.

## Literature review

In this project, the following articles will be reviewed.
