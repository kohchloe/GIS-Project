This project aims to find out the effect of school mergers in Singapore on the accessibility of schools for people. Our objectives are to analyse our findings so that we can evaluate whether there are enough schools in certain areas and how the mergers can potentially affect people's choice of housing. We plan to do so by comparing the locations of schools and their accessibility before and after merger. \nOur findings have concluded that (key findings) and this will be explored further in our report."

As a result, the government has decided to merge pairs of schools so as to ensure that all schools still have an adequate number of students and a vibrant learning experience with a good range of educational programmes and co-curricular activities.\nHence, in this project, we want to find out how these mergers have affected the accessibility of schools in Singapore for students. We studied the data collected and prepared a report to present our findings and results."
