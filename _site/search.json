They generally also have more schools than in other subzones.\nMost of the pre-tertiary schools are clustered towards the central region of Singapore, but it does not have a direct correlation to the distribution of young. However, there is at least one pre-tertiary school in each region (e.g. West, North, East)."

Grey indicates that there was no change in population during the two years.\nOur analysis is as follows.\n\nComparing 2015 and 2017 Young Population\n\nChoa Chu Kang, Yunnan, Pasir Ris Drive and Woodlands East all faced an increase in the number of young people. We can also see that these areas have many primary and secondary schools around which make them more accessible for residents living in the area, resulting in the increase in young people. \n\n\nFernvale, Punggol and Waterway East have a decrease in young people living in the area. However, these areas do not have that many schools densely populated in the area as compared to the areas with an increase in young people. Hence, these areas may not be that accessible to the schools and resulted in a decrease in young people living there.\n\n\n\n\nComparing 2019 and 2020 Young Population\n\nFrom 2019 to 2020, subzones that experienced an increase in the number of young people include Fernvale, Seletar and Brickworks. \n\n\nOn the other hand, examples of subzones that faced a decrease in the number of young people are Jurong West, Choa Chu Kang North, Midview and Bedok North. \n\n\nIn the East, there were two pairs of primary schools that were merged in 2019 – Casuarina Primary School and Loyang Primary School, and White Sands Primary School and Coral Primary School. Although there is a subzone with a large number of young people (Tampines North – dark blue), the neighbouring subzones (Tampines East and Pasir Ris Drive – red) had experienced a decrease in the number of young people. Hence, the decision to merge schools in this area seems to be justifiable as the demand for primary school education is likely to have decreased."

    "text": "Accessibility maps of Singapore’s educational institutions\n\nPrimary Schools\n\n\n\nAmongst the years we analysed, the merger of primary schools in 2019 resulted in the greatest change in accessibility, with 7 pairs of primary schools being merged, whereas only 4 pairs of primary schools were merged in 2015. No primary schools were merged in 2017. Hence, we will be focusing our analysis on the 2019 merger. Even in 2019, the change in accessibility was not very significant as we realised that the primary schools that were merged together were usually done for schools in close proximity. The quantile values for shortest distance are also mostly unchanged, with the only exception being the first band. In the highlighted Area 1, Balestier Hill Primary School and Bendemeer Primary School were merged together. With this merger, the accessibility in the surrounding areas decreased slightly. One example of how the shortest distance changed, was from 1628m to 2479m. \n\n\nIn the highlighted Area 2, two pairs of schools were merged — Casuarina Primary School and Loyang Primary School, and White Sands Primary School and Coral Primary School. Similarly, even though two pairs of schools were merged, the accessibility was not greatly affected as the schools were all in close proximity to one another.\n\n\nOverall, although the accessibility to primary schools decreased, the equity of access to primary schools was not greatly affected, due to the government choosing to merge schools that were already in close proximity. Additionally, there are a large number of primary schools, so each merger would not have as significant an impact on accessibility as compared to pre-tertiary institutions.\n\n\n\n\nSecondary Schools\n\n\n\nThe merger of 6 pairs of secondary schools in 2017 resulted in the greatest changes in accessibility to people. Overall, there was a decrease in accessibility as the areas that used to be of short distances of range 110-1644 from a school saw an increase in distance to the range 1723-3758. \n\n\nIn the highlighted Area 1, the merger of Damai Secondary School at Bedok and Manjusri Secondary School at Ubi has resulted in a larger decrease in accessibility as these schools are around the same area. As a result, residents living in the area used to have 3 schools near them but after the closure of the 2 schools, there is only 1 school nearby. Hence, secondary schools are not as accessible as before for these residents as seen in the shortest distance increasing from 1196m to 1951m. \n\n\nIn the highlighted Area 2, the merger of Siglap Secondary School at Pasir Ris has decreased accessibility to secondary schools for those living in the area. As seen in the diagram, the presence of Siglap Secondary School made it accessible for more residents as the area of high accessibility is larger. However, after the merger, the residents in this area. The shortest distance to the nearest school of the area where Siglap Secondary School is located increased from 110m to 2522m. \n\n\nHence, while there is an overall decrease in accessibility to secondary schools from the mergers, the impact is not extremely significant to the point where equity to access is compromised. This is due to the large number of secondary schools that are already present in Singapore and located in many different regions in Singapore. However, this is with the assumption that secondary school students travel to school by public transport and/or by foot which may not apply for everyone. Furthermore, certain people and families may prefer to go to more prestigious schools which are mostly located in the central area and is considered inaccessible to certain group of people.\n\n\n\n\nPre-tertiary Institutions\n\n\nIn 2019, 4 pairs of Junior Colleges (JC) in different regions of Singapore were merged in response to the decreasing JC intake. Given that there were originally not many JCs and there was a considerable distance between the JCs for each pair before merger, this merger had a greater decrease in accessibility compared to primary and secondary schools. In the highlighted Area 1, Serangoon Junior College merged with Anderson Junior College, causing less accessibility in the Hougang subzone. The shortest distance from schools for students living in Hougang increased from the range 0-3034 to 3285-5396. \n\n\nLikewise, in the highlighted Area 2, Tampines Junior College merged with Meridian Junior College, causing accessibility in the Tampines subzone to decrease as the shortest distance from schools for students in this Area also increased from the range 0-3034 to 3285-5396.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the merging of schools in Singapore has brought about an overall decrease in accessibility to schools across Singapore. However, while there was a decrease in accessibility, this change is still minimal as schools that were merged were in close proximity to one another. Should the government need to merge more schools, it would be advisable to continue merging schools that are already in close proximity. The impact of merging schools that are further apart from one another can be observed from the merger of pre-tertiary institutions. However, we acknowledge that as people get older (e.g. primary school students vs pre-tertiary students), they are likely to be more willing to travel a longer distance. \n\n\nThat being said, these mergers may have underlying implications on costs and standard of living which we are unable to observe directly from the visual differences between the maps. One reason for an increase in costs of living is due to the increase in time needed to travel as schools are now further away. Additionally, there may be an increase in costs as people who could previously walk to school now need to take public transport, and even for people who previously took public transport, the distance they need to travel now may be greater than before. \n\n\nHowever, our group still believes that even though there was a decrease in accessibility, the changes were minimal, hence the equity of access to schools in Singapore is still maintained."
