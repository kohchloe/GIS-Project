This is done by evaluating whether there are enough schools in each subzone and how the mergers can potentially affect people’s choice of housing.\nOur findings have concluded that the merging of schools in Singapore has brought about an overall decrease in accessibility to schools for people. While the changes in accessibility are not very significant and only certain areas in Singapore have been affected by these mergers, they can have implications on costs and standard of living. This will be explored further in our report."

    "text": "Singapore has been facing a serious issue of low birth rates and changing demographics in our housing estates in recent years. As a result, the government has decided to merge pairs of schools so as to ensure that all schools still have an adequate number of students and a vibrant learning experience with a good range of educational programmes and co-curricular activities.\nThrough this project, we want to find out how these mergers have affected the accessibility of schools in Singapore for students. We hope to be able to provide meaningful insights on the effects of these mergers so as to provide actionable suggestions for future planning of land use."

    "text": "Before you can start to perform any analysis, you need to load all the appropriate GIS data into QGIS.\n\n\nWe will first add our Masterplan 2019 Subzone into our GIS Layer, this will serve as the base map layer for our study. It contains polygons for the land spaces in Singapore.\nHover over to Layer tab > Add Layer > Add Vector Layer...\nClick add vector layer and you should be able to see the Data Source Manager | Vector,  select the master-plan-2019-subzone-boundary-no-sea-geojson.geojson file.\n\n\n\nThis Data Layer provides the population of different age groups at different locations in Singapore in csv. File.\nFirstly, add in respopagesex2000to2010.csv and respopagesex2011to2020.csv, under Layer tab > Add Layer > Add Delimited Text Layer.\nOnce you clicked on Add Delimited Text Layer you should see the Data Source Manager | Delimited Text. You should search for respopagesex2000to2010.csv.\nAfter adding the csv file, it will appear under Layers. Repeat the same steps to open respopagesex2011to2020.csv.\n \nBefore you can perform attribute query, you need to examine both respopagesex2000to2010.csv and respopagesex2011to2020.csv layers carefully and to identify the appropriate field and object name (s) to query.\n●  At Browser pane, right-click on respopagesex2000to2010.\n●  From the context menu, select Open Attribute Table.\n \nThe Attribute Table window appears.\nIn our study, we are only interested in finding the populations in year 2000, 2010 and 2020. Hence, we can filter out the desired data using the Expression icon.\n\n\n\nNow, you are going to enter the expression.\n●  From the Expression pane, click on \"=\"  icon.\nNext, you are going to complete the query statement by providing the field value.\n●  At the Values pane, click on the all unique button.\nYour screen should look similar to the figure below.\n\nChange the year accordingly to 2000 and 2010.\n\n\nAfter entering the query, click on Select Features and close the window. We will see that all the data with \"Time\" = '2020' selected only as shown below.\n\n\nClose the attribute table and right click on the layer. Go to Export > Save Selected Features As.. to save the layer with only 2020 values into a new GeoPackage layer.\n\n\nWe will name this exported layer as Population2020.\n\nRepeat the steps to obtain the data for the 2000 and 2010 datasets.\n \nAfter exporting the layers, we should see them appear on the Layers tab as shown below. We can now remove the respopagesex2000to2010 and respopagesex2011to2020 layers.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that we have all the data that we need for analysis, we want to get the geographical distribution. We will do so by creating a virtual layer and using SQL statements to get the data to be shown on the map.\n \nLayers > Create Layer > New Virtual Layer\n\n\n\nWe will create 6 different virtual layers, Young_Population2020, Aged_Population2020, Young_Population2010, Aged_Population2010, Young_Population2000, Aged_Population2000\n \nImport the GeoPackage layers under Embedded layers and enter the following query in the query tab.\n\n\nAfter adding, a new layer is created. To better understand, let's open the attribute table of this new layer. We see 2 new attributes created: PopYoung and PopSZ.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo do a Join, we need to find a common attribute between 2 tables. However, we notice that the column SZ in our Population layers are all in lowercase while that of the Subzone layers are in uppercase. Hence, we will add a new attribute in the population layers as SUBZONE.\n \nRight click on the layer name and select Open Attribute Table > Open Field Calculator\n \nFill in the Output field name as SUBZONE, output field type as Text and the following expression into Expression tab.\n\nAfter clicking OK, we see a new column SUBZONE created which is now in uppercase.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that all the required data are present, we can now perform a join. When we perform a join, we will join based on the common attributes that both layers have which in this case is SUBZONE of the population layers and SUBZONE_N of the subzone layers.\n \nRight click on the URA_MP19_SUBZONE_NO_SEA_PL layer > Properties.. > Joins\n\n\n·  For the Join layer, we select the year that corresponds to the subzone layer used.\n·  For the Join field, we select SUBZONE\n·  For Target field, we select SUBZONE_N\n \nThen select OK. We will see the joined layer under the join tab.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nTo create a choropleth map, right click on the Subzone layers where we performed the Join previously and select Properties > Symbology\n·  Select Graduated from the dropdown box at the top\n·  For the Value, select the PopAged column that we have obtained from the join.\n·  For the Mode, we will be using Natural Breaks (Jenks).\n·  For Classes, we will select 6. This is because we want to isolate the areas where there is 0 population, in other words, inhabitable. Hence, there will be a total of 5 ranges and an additional one to represent inhabitable areas.\n·  We will change the colour of the inhabitable areas with range 0-1 to a distinct colour such as black so that we can easily distinguish it.\n·  As for the Colour ramp, we will be selecting Blues.\nAs we will be comparing across the different years, we need to standardize the ranges for our choropleth map for all maps. We will use the following values:\n\n\n\nThese values have been selected as the largest value for all Aged population is 21452 and we want 5 classes, so we take the ranges of 21452/5. We will do the same for Young population to get the range.\nAfter clicking Apply and OK, we will get the map as shown below."
