This is done by evaluating whether there are enough schools in each subzone and how the mergers can potentially affect people’s choice of housing.\nOur findings have concluded that the merging of schools in Singapore has brought about an overall decrease in accessibility to schools for people. While the changes in accessibility are not very significant and only certain areas in Singapore have been affected by these mergers, they can have implications on costs and standard of living. This will be explored further in our report."

As a result, the government has decided to merge pairs of schools so as to ensure that all schools still have an adequate number of students and a vibrant learning experience with a good range of educational programmes and co-curricular activities.\nThrough this project, we want to find out how these mergers have affected the accessibility of schools in Singapore for students.
