The mergers were conducted with the intention of better allocating resources to areas that may need such as land for redevelopment."

We also wanted to find out which areas have less schools and hence are less accessible which may potentially affect the choices of housing. Afterwards, we want to analyse how all these factors have affected the equity of access to schools in Singapore. We also considered finding the benefits to those where the school merged as compared to how people living near the area of closed down schools have 'suffered' from it.\n*However, upon consultation with Prof Kam, we decided to modify our project objective as this may not be a realistic objective for this project."
