On the whole, primary and secondary schools are spread across Singapore, but subzones in the highest band (with 118960-17640 young people) have minimally one primary and secondary school each, within the area of the subzone. They generally also have more schools than in other subzones.

Most of the pre-tertiary schools are clustered towards the central region of Singapore, but it does not have a direct correlation to the distribution of young. However, there is at least one pre-tertiary school in each region (e.g. West, North, East).
