MerGIS was brought forth as part of the SMT201 Geographical Information Systems for Urban Planning module supported by Professor Kam Tin Seong from Singapore Management University's School of Computing and Information Systems.

Due to the low birth rates and changing demographics in Singapore, the government has decided to merge different primary, secondary and tertiary schools so as to meet the demands of the changing population.

This project aims to **find out the effect that school mergers in Singapore has on Singaporeans' accessibility to schools**. This is done by evaluating whether there are enough schools in each subzone and how the mergers can potentially affect people's choice of housing.

Our findings have concluded that the merger of schools in Singapore does not have significant impacts on equity of access to schools. However, the merger of pre tertiary institutions has the most significant impact compared to other school types. This will be explored further in our report.Â \
